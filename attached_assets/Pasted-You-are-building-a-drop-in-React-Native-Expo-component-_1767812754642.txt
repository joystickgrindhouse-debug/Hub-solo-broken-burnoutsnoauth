You are building a **drop-in React Native / Expo component** for an existing fitness app. The module must integrate **directly into an existing app and chatbox**, using the existing Firebase authentication and Firestore database.  

Requirements:

1. **Component Name & Structure**
   - Main component: `ChatbotTour.js`
   - Subcomponents: `TourStep.js`, `ChatBubble.js`, `LogsGraph.js`, `NutritionalCoach.js`
   - Component must **not overwrite or conflict** with existing files
   - Props:  
     - `user` → current authenticated user object  
     - `firebase` → existing Firebase instance  
     - `onTourComplete` → callback after tour completion  
     - `initialMessage` → optional initial greeting message  

2. **Firebase Integration**
   - Use the **existing Firebase instance**
   - Read/write to:
     - `users` → profile data  
     - `logs` → daily weight, mood, meals, workouts, runs  
     - `achievements` → milestones & streaks  
     - `leaderboard` → points/activity
   - Real-time listeners for leaderboard and global chat
   - Ensure all operations respect the authenticated user (`firebase.auth().currentUser.uid`)

3. **Chatbot Behavior**
   - Opens automatically on login with a **motivational greeting** (from `initialMessage`)  
   - Responds to:
     - Account updates: nickname, bio  
     - Support requests: “Support will respond shortly”  
     - Nutritional guidance (meal plans, macros)  
     - Daily logs & session feedback (weight, mood emoji, meals, workouts/runs)  
     - Milestones, streak rewards, and trend insights

4. **Tour Flow**
   - 7-step interactive tour:
     1. Upload avatar  
     2. Profile: bio, achievements, milestones  
     3. Leaderboard & social: global chat & DMs  
     4. Workout demos: Solo Mode, Burnouts, Run Mode (distance & time), Live Mode  
     5. Shop tour  
     6. Optional: Workout plan setup (user can skip)  
     7. Close tour and switch to normal app mode  

5. **Logging & Graphs**
   - Logs stored in Firebase per user
   - Graphs for trends in weight, mood, distance, calories
   - Chatbot provides insights based on trends

6. **UI / Styling**
   - Red neon primary color (#FF0000) with dark backgrounds (#000000 / #111111)  
   - Neon-style buttons, chat bubbles, progress indicators  
   - Smooth glowing accents for interactive elements  
   - Must blend seamlessly with an existing app’s navigation  

7. **Example JSON Templates**
   - Pre-filled examples for:
     - Daily logs: weight, mood, meals, workouts, runs
     - Nutritional plans: calories, macros, meals
     - Achievements & streaks

8. **Integration Instructions**
   - Component must be **self-contained and plug-and-play**  
   - All Firebase paths configurable if needed  
   - No new Firebase instance created  
   - Local state used internally unless updating Firebase  

9. **Output**
   - Provide **full component code**, subcomponents, and example JSON files  
   - Include ready-to-use functions for:
     - Tour navigation  
     - Chatbot responses  
     - Logging and updating Firebase  
     - Graph generation  
     - Optional workout plan setup  
   - Must **run immediately** in Replit / Expo and integrate into an existing React Native app

Focus on making a **drop-in, fully integrated ChatbotTour module** with **auto-open greeting**, **tour flow**, **nutritional coach**, **logs**, **streaks**, and **red neon UI**. The module should be ready to **just drop into an existing chatbox in a fitness app**.
