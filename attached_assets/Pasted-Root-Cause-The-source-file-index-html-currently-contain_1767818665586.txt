Root Cause

The source file ******/index.html currently contains:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/index-3fb5969d.css" />
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
This is problematic because:

The CSS file /assets/index-3fb5969d.css doesn't exist in the source code - This is a hashed filename that only exists AFTER Vite builds the project into the dist/ folder. Without CSS, the page has a black background (background-color: #000000 is set in main.css), and no visible styling is applied.

The JavaScript points to /src/main.jsx - While this file exists, when served as a script directly without Vite's transpilation, browsers cannot execute JSX syntax. The browser will fail to parse it, resulting in React never mounting.

The combination = black screen - No CSS loaded (black background default) + No JavaScript executing (React never renders) = blank black screen with no visible content.

Why This Happened

Based on commit 322b6ce ("Correct app loading issues and update asset paths for deployment"), the source index.html was incorrectly modified to reference the built asset path. This was likely an attempt to fix a previous issue but created a new one.

The correct source index.html should look like:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Rivalis Hub</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
</body>
</html>
Note: The CSS import happens inside main.jsx via import "../assets/styles/main.css" - Vite handles bundling this automatically during build.

Why The Built Version Works Differently

The built dist/index.html is correctly generated by Vite with:

Proper hashed CSS: /assets/index-3fb5969d.css
Bundled JavaScript: /assets/index-214183e7.js
Module preloads for vendor chunks
If Netlify is correctly building and serving from dist/, the production site should work. The black screen may occur in these scenarios:

Development mode - Running the source locally without npm run dev
Build failures - If the Netlify build fails, stale assets may be served
Cache issues - Browser or CDN caching old assets
Missing environment variables - Firebase requires these VITE_* environment variables to be set:
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
Additional Contributing Factors

30-Second Loading Screen

The app intentionally shows a loading screen for up to 30 seconds (App.jsx:56-59). During this time, users see a LoadingScreen component, which may appear black if styles aren't loaded.

CSS Default Background

The main.css sets background-color: #000000 (black) as the default body background. Without proper styling or JavaScript rendering, users see only this black background.

Firebase Initialization

If Firebase environment variables are missing, the app will crash before React can render anything, resulting in a blank screen.

Recommended Fixes

The agent has not made any changes. The following fixes are recommended:

Fix source index.html - Remove the hardcoded CSS link and keep only the module script pointing to src/main.jsx. Vite will inject the proper assets during build.

Verify Netlify environment variables - Ensure all VITE_FIREBASE_* variables are configured in the Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables.

Clear cache and redeploy - After fixing, clear the Netlify build cache and trigger a fresh deploy.

Check browser console - Open DevTools (F12) and look at the Console and Network tabs for specific error messages.

How to Debug

To identify the exact cause on the live site:

Open the deployed site in a browser
Open Developer Tools (F12)
Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors
Check the Network tab - look for 404 errors on CSS or JS files
Verify that files in /assets/ are loading correctly
The error messages in the console will confirm which of the above issues is causing the black screen.
