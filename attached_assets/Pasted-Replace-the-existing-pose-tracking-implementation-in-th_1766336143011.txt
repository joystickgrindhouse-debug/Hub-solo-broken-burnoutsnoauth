Replace the existing pose tracking implementation in this project with MoveNet Thunder using TensorFlow.js.
Requirements:
Pose Tracking
Use MoveNet Thunder (movenet_thunder) from TensorFlow.js
Run fully in the browser using the webcam
Track 17 keypoints reliably in real time
Smooth landmark positions using a moving average or similar filter to reduce jitter
Video & Overlay
Display live webcam video
Draw a real-time skeleton overlay on a canvas
Render joints and limb connections clearly
Ensure skeleton stays aligned with the video feed
Reference Movement / Form Target
Define ideal joint angle ranges for push-ups (elbows, shoulders, hips)
Support looping a reference “correct form” target (angle-based, not video)
Continuously compare user pose to ideal ranges
Form Corrections (Audio + Logic)
Detect common push-up form issues:
Chest not low enough
Right or left hip too high or uneven
Elbow angle not bending enough
Use Web Speech API for audible coaching cues such as:
“Lower your chest”
“Lower your right hip”
“Keep your hips level”
Throttle audio feedback to avoid repeating too frequently
Rep Counting
Implement a reliable rep counter using a state machine:
Top position → Bottom position → Top position = 1 rep
Base rep detection on elbow angle and chest height
Display a live visual rep counter
Speak the rep number aloud when a rep is completed
Exercise Cards & Progression
Define exercise cards with:
Exercise name
Target rep count
Automatically advance to the next card when target reps are reached
Reset rep counter for each new card
Tracking & Stats
Track total reps completed across all exercises
Display total reps on screen
Code Structure
Remove or disable all previous pose tracking code (MediaPipe or others)
Use clean, well-commented JavaScript
Separate logic for:
Pose detection
Angle calculations
Rep counting
Audio feedback
UI updates
The final result should be a stable, real-time fitness form tracker using MoveNet Thunder with visual skeleton overlay, audible coaching, rep counting, exercise progression, and total rep tracking.
