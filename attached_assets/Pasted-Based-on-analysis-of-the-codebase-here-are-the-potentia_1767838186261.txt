Based on analysis of the codebase, here are the potential causes and fixes for the black screen issue:

Most Likely Causes and Solutions

1. Asset Path Issue for Loading Background Image

Location: src/components/LoadingScreen.jsx (around line 45)

The loading screen uses a hardcoded path url('/loading-bg.png') for the background image. In production, this path may not resolve correctly.

Fix: Import the image properly using Vite's asset handling:

import loadingBg from '/public/loading-bg.png';
// Then use: backgroundImage: `url('${loadingBg}')`
Or move the image to the public folder root and ensure it's copied to the build output.

2. All-Black Styling Masks Errors

Location: assets/styles/main.css (lines 9-14, 22, 37-47)

The entire page has background-color: #000000 applied to body, html, .hero-background, and .dashboard-background. If React fails to render, users see only black with no error indication.

Fix: Add a temporary non-black fallback or loading indicator in index.html:

<div id="root">
  <div style="color: white; text-align: center; padding-top: 40vh;">Loading...</div>
</div>
This provides visual feedback while React loads, and gets replaced once the app mounts.

3. ErrorBoundary Displays Black Background

Location: src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx (line 39)

Even the error boundary renders with a black background, so errors appear as black screens too.

Fix: Change the error boundary's fallback background to a different color (like dark gray #333) so errors are visually distinct from the loading screen.

4. Long Loading Duration

Location: src/App.jsx (lines 57, 76)

The app enforces minimum loading times (MINIMUM_LOADING_TIME = 3000ms, plus the initialHype state). If the loading screen component fails silently, users stare at black for at least 5 seconds.

Fix: Add console.log statements or use React Developer Tools to verify the LoadingScreen component is actually rendering.

5. Image Import Paths for Dashboard

Location: src/views/Dashboard.jsx (lines 4-8)

Images are imported with absolute paths like /assets/images/solo.png. Vite should handle these, but if there's a mismatch, components may fail.

Fix: Verify images exist at the expected paths and consider using relative imports or moving images to the public folder.

Quick Debugging Steps

Check browser console for JavaScript errors when loading the site
Check Network tab in browser DevTools for failed asset requests (especially images and scripts)
Temporarily change the body background in main.css to something visible like #333 to distinguish between "nothing rendered" vs "black content rendered"
Add a fallback message in the #root div in index.html to confirm React is mounting
